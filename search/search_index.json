This formal exercise must leave results confirmed by experiment in place. Instead of getting one equation however, the result is always four equations. These well-formed \"extra\" equations may provide new avenues for research. At least that is goal. In the literature, a number of people have figured out how to represent the Lorentz group using a complex-valued quaternion triple function. The work with spinors is like this. Because complex-valued quaternions are not a division algebra, such efforts violate my research effort. In 2010, I figured out a triple triple product to do boosts. In 2013, I noticed the very same function could also do rotations easily enough. In 2019, two people with Ph.D.'s strongly disagreed with my claim that a one parameter function and thus at most four degrees of freedom could possibly represent all possible Lorentz transformations which has been long known to have three degrees of rotation for rotations and three for boosts. Because six is greater than four, my claim must necessarily be wrong, or so it is reasonably claimed. This repo contains a Jupyter notebook which argues my side of the case. Please read it and let me know what you think. As Jupyter Notebooks: Lorentz boost with just h Replies and responses As PDFs: Lorentz boost with just h Replies and responses The Jupyter notebook served on line is of no use since at the moment, it shows the input cells but not output. Still, you can download and run locally.
