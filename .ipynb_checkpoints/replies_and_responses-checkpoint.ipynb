    "> I really do want to help you understand more, but I am unsure how to make progress. You continue to make new mistakes and move on before you take the time to learn from previous discussions. We never get anywhere this way, often cycling back to previous misunderstandings. What exactly do you want me to do?\n",
    " \n",
    "> After reading, here are four main points.\n",
    " \n",
    "> 1) You misunderstand Aaronson's argument. Please take the time to learn QM instead of superficially recreating equations you see in a book to have quaternions. I can help you learn more about QM, but you have to actually choose to seek this as the goal first. He is not using high level concepts here. You should be able to understand this if you take the time. It will be worth it.\n",
    " \n",
    "> 1b) As Aaronson tried to explain to you (and I've tried repeatedly to explain as well), the \"space\" from which a vector describing the state of a qubit comes from is a Hilbert space, not the space of space-time. Taking the dual of a state vector is not mirroring or flipping in space-time. Likewise the presence of a conjugate in the norm doesn't mean there is something non-local going on.\n",
    " \n",
    "> 2) The Lorentz group has 6 real degrees of freedom. We have discussed this at great length. We can discuss even more, but I'd appreciate if we could finally run this to ground and complete it.\n",
    " \n",
    "> 3) You have redefined what a \"solution\" is, to the point where the result has lost all meaning. It is equivalent to claiming B' = B + h can define any transformation, if, as you say, I can make the solution \"local\".  This trivializes the concept of a \"solution\" to the point of being completely vacuous. \n",
    " \n",
    "> So, do you believe the transformation B' = B + h describes a rotation?\n",
    " \n",
    "> Even better, if the components of h can be a function of the components of B, why even bother with B? Just declare the ultimate transformation\n",
    " B' = h\n",
    "Tell me what you want B' to equal for a particular B and I'll give you the h which \"solves\" this transformation equation to make B' equal that.\n",
    "This is completely vacuous.\n",
    " \n",
    "> 4) If you are starting to consider a collection of four functions as components of a quaternion, this object is no longer a quaternion, but a different type of mathematical object.\n",
    " \n",
    "> For example, for real number polynomials of one parameter, the set is R[x]. For complex polynomials of one parameter it would be C[x]. For quaternions, what is a polynomial may need a bit of defining since values do not commute, but would be H[x].\n",
    "Note that these objects, or more general \"quaternion of functions\", would no longer be a division algebra."

    "> 1) You misunderstand Aaronson's argument. Please take the time to learn QM instead of superficially recreating equations you see in a book to have quaternions. I can help you learn more about QM, but you have to actually choose to seek this as the goal first. He is not using high level concepts here. You should be able to understand this if you take the time. It will be worth it."

    "One can see this as a generous offer for assistence. I do read it that way. My own experience says that would not be effective. In the early 1990s, as I worked as a biology lab technician at the Harvard School of Public Health, I was able to audit a full year of undergraduate quantum mechanics followed by a second year of graduate level quantum mechanics (relativisitic quantum field theory, doing Feynman scattering calculations and similar things). That is the kind of time investment required to learn the details of quantum mechanics. It is clear that over three decades, most details needed for detailed calculations have been lost, like I know that there are selection rules required for scattering calculations, but I could not write one down."

If one chooses to call my replication of that effort superficial, that is a judgment call you are free to make. I recall the same sorts of basic steps are done in technical books on quantum mechanics. Basic stuff is easy but still needs to be done."

    "It is easy for me to imagine someone with formal training to immediately claim such an identity will fail because quaternions do not commute. In a quaternion product, the only part that does not commute is the cross product. The cross product anti-commutes. An anti-anti-commutes is the same as something that commutes. "
