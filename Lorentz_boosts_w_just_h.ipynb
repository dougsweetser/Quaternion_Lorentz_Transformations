    "Quaternions ($C \\ell_{0, 2}(\\mathcal{R})$) were known to have four degrees of freedom and do rotations in three spatial dimensions in the eighteen forties. Special relativity was created by Einstein in 1905. His math professor Minkowski recognized the Lorentz transformation as a rotation in the four dimensional vector space in 1908. It would appear that quaternions were tailor-made to do the work of Lorentz transformations. Early on, two people did give it a try: Conway (1911) and Silberstein (1912). What they both realized was that the triple product used for rotations could only work for complex-valued quaternions $C \\ell_{1, 2}(\\mathcal{R})$:\n",

    "I suspect many physists do not care about the details of the math being used - that is for mathematicians to understand. That flies in the face of how central math is to physics. To my eye, when physics is done right, there is no difference between math and physics. This is why for me deciding what math to use is of ultimate importance. Physical laws have to be reversable. For that reason, the most basic math operations of all - addition and multiplication - must be reversable. If that is not the case, then there will be math operations that are not consistent with the reversability seen in physics. This is not a guiding principle in mainstream physics, but it is for me."

Since rotations are not boosts, that means one must have at a minimum parameter with six degrees of freedom.

    "I have worked with quaternions as a number since 1997. Numbers in and of themselves are not viewed as a form of higher math. Numbers are grains of sand with little structure while the deep actions happen in the ocean of abstract mathematics. Little is not however none. Each time I have tried to apply quaternions to a problem in physics, eventually a solution was found. With the entire number system open, I was confident that a transformation to $B' = (t, -y, x, z)$ was necessarily possible even if I didn't know any details at the time. I therefore made a 1-way wager, that I could find a parameter $h$ for the triple triple quaternion function that could do that specific transformation. If I failed at such a task, I would donate \\$100 to a charity of Purple Penguin's choice (I suggested the American Diabetes Association which he agreed to). Money can be a motivator, and I would have to create this notebook and video any answer to address the wager."
